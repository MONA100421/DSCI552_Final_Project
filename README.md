# ‚ôªÔ∏è Transfer Learning for Waste Image Classification

**Highlight:** Built an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to classify 9 categories of real-world waste images. Compared multiple pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50/101, EfficientNetB0, VGG16) using transfer learning and regularization. Achieved **56% accuracy** on the RealWaste dataset with VGG16 as the best-performing model.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a **production-style ML workflow**:
- **Data Preparation:** 4,752 waste images across 9 categories, resized to 224√ó224 with OpenCV, normalized and one-hot encoded.
- **Augmentation:** Combined OpenCV preprocessing (random crop, contrast adjustment) with Keras‚Äô `ImageDataGenerator` (rotation, zoom, flips).
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuned four ImageNet pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50, ResNet101, EfficientNetB0, VGG16).
- **Training Strategy:** 100 epochs with early stopping, 20% validation split, dropout & L2 regularization.
- **Evaluation:** Reported training/validation loss curves, accuracy metrics, and test set performance.
